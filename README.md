I enjoy code streaming. There's a lot of great channel that streams live coding on Twich. But I found that it was hard to find coding channel that is good and active. So I gathered some of the best channels and gathered them here.

This app is a directory to find some of the best code streaming channel on twitch.tv. It shows you a the list of different channels along with live meta information like weather they are streaming right now, what they are steaming etc. You can also look up for any channel on Twitch using the Search UI. This app was made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It uses the twitch.tv API to fetch channel information.

If you don't see you favorite coding channel here and want to include, feel free to create a PR. :)
